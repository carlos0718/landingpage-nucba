                    <summary>What is Frontend Practice?</summary>
                    <p>Frontend Practice offers developers the opportunity to practice and improve their skills in
                        design, interactions,
                        animations, responsiveness, troubleshooting, and more by providing a selection of real websites
                        for them to recreate
                        from scratch. This hands-on approach allows developers to gain a diverse set of valuable skills
                        that will make them more
                        employable in the industry.</p>

                <details class="question faq-2">
                    <summary> Where can I find images and icons?</summary>
                    <p><span>Pexels</span> and <span>Pixabay</span> are excellent sources for free stock photos, while
                        <span>Boxicons</span> and
                        <span>Font Awesome</span>
                        offer a variety of free
                        icons. Links to these resources can be found at the top of every project page on Frontend
                        Practice.

                    <summary>Where is the code?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Frontend Practice does not provide any pre-written code, but we do offer a few resources to
                        assist with each project.
                        However, there will always be unexpected challenges that arise during the learning process,
                        which is where the true
                        learning begins.

                        If you want a more structured approach to learning coding, consider taking Frontend Masters'

                        The beauty of recreating websites for practice is that you can utilize any tech stack, such as
                        HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or any other language, framework, or library.

                    <summary> Why did you pick these websites?</summary>
                    <p>The selection of websites featured on Frontend Practice is based on personal preference and takes
                        into consideration
                        various factors, including design and style, difficulty to recreate, and elements and features
                        that offer a learning
                        opportunity through recreation.

                    <summary>Can I use these in my portfolio?</summary>
                    <p>We encourage you to make these projects your own by incorporating your own colors, content, and
                        images. If you choose to
                        use these projects for your portfolio, please clearly state that it is an "unofficial" version.

                    <summary>Why does the live website not look like the project anymore?</summary>
                    <p>How dare they update the website! We will talk with their manager right away. If they don't
                        respond, we'll periodically
                        check the websites we feature and make the necessary updates.

                        In some cases, if we really love the previous design, we may keep it and link to an archived
                        page if possible. If not,
                        please see the reference image on the project page.

                    <p>Occasionally we will retire projects from the main collection if the design is no longer up to
                        date or an archived
                        version is not available.
